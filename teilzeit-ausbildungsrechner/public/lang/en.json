The content gives you a first overview and helps you understand the basics. For detailed information you can also find a link to the <strong>Netzwerk Teilzeitausbildung Baden-Württemberg</strong> further below.",
  "faq_section_parttime_title": "Questions about part-time apprenticeship",
  "faq_q1_title": "Who can do an apprenticeship part-time?",
  "faq_q1_body": "<p>A part-time apprenticeship offers <strong>flexibility</strong> when a full-time apprenticeship is not or no longer possible because of your personal situation.</p><p>Since <strong>1 January 2020</strong> basically <strong>anyone</strong> can do a part-time apprenticeship – the requirement is that <strong>employer and apprentice agree</strong>.</p><p>Typical examples:</p><ul><li>People with <strong>childcare</strong> responsibilities</li><li>People who <strong>care for relatives</strong></li><li>People with a <strong>disability</strong></li><li><strong>Refugees</strong> who need or want to work alongside the apprenticeship</li></ul><p>A <strong>retraining</strong> can also be done part-time.</p>",
  "faq_q2_title": "Is vocational school also part-time?",
  "faq_q2_body": "<p><strong>Vocational school</strong> usually runs the same as in a full-time apprenticeship. The part-time arrangement mainly concerns the <strong>working time in the company</strong>.</p><ul><li>The <strong>amount of teaching</strong> usually stays the same.</li><li>Separate <strong>part-time classes</strong> only exist if enough students sign up.</li><li>In individual cases <strong>custom solutions</strong> are possible, e.g. if class times do not fit childcare – ask the school.</li></ul>",
  "faq_q3_title": "What does the weekly working time look like in part-time?",
  "faq_q3_body": "<p>In part-time the <strong>working hours in the company</strong> are reduced – not the training content.</p><ul><li>How many hours per week you work is agreed <strong>with your company</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>reduction</strong> of company hours should generally <strong>not exceed 50%</strong>.</li><li>Depending on hours, the <strong>total duration can be extended</strong>.</li></ul><p>A part-time apprenticeship is also possible if the <strong>regular duration stays the same</strong> – then only the <strong>weekly hours</strong> are reduced, not the duration.</p>",
  "faq_q4_title": "How long does a part-time apprenticeship take?",
  "faq_q4_body": "<p>The goal is always a <strong>full qualification</strong> equivalent to full-time. Because of fewer hours in the company, the duration can increase.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Regular <strong>3 years</strong> \u279c cut to about <strong>75%</strong> hours: <strong>4 years</strong> total</li><li>Regular <strong>3 years</strong> \u279c cut to about <strong>50%</strong> hours: <strong>4.5 years</strong> total</li></ul><p>It is also possible to complete within the <strong>regular duration under \u00a78 (1) BBiG</strong> and fix the end date contractually (possibly with a shortening request to the chamber).</p>",
  "faq_section_shortening_title": "Questions about shortening the apprenticeship",
  "faq_q5_title": "Which reasons allow a shortening?",
  "faq_q5_body": "<p>There are several <strong>reasons for shortening</strong> that can be considered individually or combined (total usually max. <strong>12 months</strong>):</p><ul><li><strong>Family or care duties</strong>: up to 12 months</li><li><strong>Age over 21</strong> (at start): up to 12 months</li><li><strong>School degree</strong>:<ul><li>Intermediate / technical entrance: up to 6 months</li><li>General university entrance (A-levels): up to 12 months</li></ul></li><li><strong>Work experience</strong> (completed apprenticeship, relevant basic training or relevant job): up to 12 months</li></ul><p>Multiple reasons can be combined, but the <strong>sum is capped</strong> and the <strong>legal minimum duration</strong> must not be undercut.</p>",
  "faq_q6_title": "How short can an apprenticeship become?",
  "faq_q6_body": "<p>Besides the cap on shortening reasons there are <strong>legal minimum durations</strong> that cannot be undercut:</p><ul><li>Regular 3.5 years \u279c minimum 2 years</li><li>Regular 3 years \u279c minimum 1.5 years</li><li>Regular 2 years \u279c minimum 1 year</li></ul><p>The exact calculation can be done by a <strong>calculator</strong> or the competent chamber.</p>",
  "faq_q7_title": "What is \u201cearly examination\u201d?",
  "faq_q7_body": "<p>Independent of part-time or shortening you can be admitted early to the exam under <strong>\u00a745 (1) BBiG</strong>. Typical requirements:</p><ul><li>very good <strong>on-the-job performance</strong> and company support</li><li>good <strong>school results</strong> (e.g. average 2.5 or better in exam subjects)</li></ul><p>You need to submit the relevant forms to the <strong>competent chamber</strong>.</p>",
  "faq_q8_title": "Where do I apply for shortening?",
  "faq_q8_body": "<p>The application is always submitted <strong>together</strong> by you and your company.</p><p>Responsible are usually:</p><ul><li>Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK)</li><li>Chamber of Crafts (HWK)</li></ul><p>Ideally apply <strong>before the apprenticeship starts</strong>. Shortening during the apprenticeship is also possible \u2013 ask the chamber.</p>",
  "faq_section_work_title": "Working time, vacation and pay",
  "faq_q9_title": "Can I switch between full-time and part-time?",
  "faq_q9_body": "<p>Yes, in many cases a <strong>switch</strong> is possible:</p><ul><li>from full-time <strong>to part-time</strong> if new reasons arise (e.g. child, care)</li><li>from part-time <strong>back to full-time</strong> if reasons disappear</li></ul><p>The request is always filed <strong>with the company</strong> to the competent chamber.</p>",
  "faq_q10_title": "How is part-time working time distributed?",
  "faq_q10_body": "<p>The exact <strong>distribution of working hours</strong> is agreed between you and the company. Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Vocational school time</strong> is deducted from weekly hours.</li><li>The remaining hours are distributed to create <strong>useful shifts</strong>.</li><li>In some professions <strong>edge hours</strong> matter (e.g. Saturday retail, early bakery shifts).</li></ul>",
  "faq_q11_title": "Do vacation and pay get reduced?",
  "faq_q11_body": "<p><strong>Vacation entitlement</strong> depends on <strong>working days per week</strong>.</p><ul><li>Example: 5 days \u279c 30 days, 4 days \u279c <strong>24 days</strong> (30 : 5 \u00d7 4)</li></ul><p><strong>Apprentice pay</strong> may be reduced <strong>proportionally to hours</strong>, but it does not have to be. Many companies still pay <strong>full pay</strong> so finances work out.</p><p>For living costs there are various <strong>grants and benefits</strong> (e.g. BAB, basic income, housing benefit, parental allowance). Agencies like the <strong>Employment Agency or Jobcenter</strong> can advise.</p>",
  "faq_section_more_title": "More information on part-time apprenticeship",
  "faq_more_body": "<p>Detailed information, examples, funding options and counseling on part-time apprenticeship can be found at the <strong>Netzwerk Teilzeitausbildung Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg</strong>.</p><p>\u279c <a href=\"https://netzwerk-teilzeitausbildung-bw.de/tza-bw/Informationen-zur-TZA/Infos-fuer-azubis.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">To the info page for prospective apprentices</a></p><p class=\"faq-link-box-note\">Note: The link leads to an external site with detailed info on funding, counseling and legal basics.</p>",
